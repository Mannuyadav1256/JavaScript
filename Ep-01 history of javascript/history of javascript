JavaScript developed by Brendan each in 1995 browser is Netscape 
the language was called "Mocha". Then it was changed to "Livescript"
And then finally is called JavaScript.

 Atwood's law
"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."

Question 
Q.1  what was original purpose of  creating JavaScript?
Ans:-  
          JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape with a very specific purpose in mind:
      to make web pages interactive. At the time, web content was mostly static, consisting of simple text and images.
      Eich's vision was to enable dynamic user interactions, animations, and more engaging web experiences.
      JavaScript was designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate with HTML. 
      It allowed web developers to add interactive features like form validation, responsive user interfaces,
      and multimedia elements to their websites. Over time, JavaScript evolved and became a fundamental technology for
      building modern web applications, making it possible to create rich, interactive, and dynamic web experiences
  
Q.2 is JavaScript compiled or interpreted?
   Ans:-
               JavaScript is traditionally an interpreted language. This means that it is executed line-by-   line by an interpreter.
        However, modern JavaScript engines like Google's V8 (used in Chrome   and Node.js) use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques
        to improve performance. This means  that parts of the JavaScript code are compiled into machine code just before execution, 
        which  combines the benefits of both interpretation and compilation.

        So, JavaScript is primarily interpreted, but with modern advancements, it can also be compiled on-the-fly to optimize performance.
