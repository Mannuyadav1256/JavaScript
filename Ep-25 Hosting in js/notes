When you talk about "hosting" in JavaScript, it usually refers to **hoisting**, which is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function
declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code execution.

Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Hoisting with Variables**

In JavaScript, variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, but **only the declaration** is hoisted, not the 
initialization.

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // undefined
var myVar = 5;
console.log(myVar); // 5
```

In the above code:
- The declaration `var myVar;` is hoisted to the top.
- However, the assignment `myVar = 5;` happens only at the line where it is written.

With `let` and `const`, the variable is hoisted but remains in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until the 
declaration is encountered, meaning accessing the variable before it’s declared results in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization
let myVar = 5;
```

### 2. **Hoisting with Functions**

Function declarations are also hoisted, and both the declaration and the definition are moved to the top of the scope.

```javascript
myFunction(); // "Hello!"

function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In the above code, even though `myFunction()` is called before the actual declaration, it works because the entire function definition 
is hoisted.

However, **function expressions** are different:

```javascript
myFunction(); // TypeError: myFunction is not a function

var myFunction = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
```

Here, the `myFunction` variable is hoisted, but only the variable declaration (not the function expression), so calling it before
the assignment results in an error.

### Summary:

- **`var`** declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, but only the declaration, not the initialization.
- **`let` and `const`** are also hoisted but cannot be used before they are defined due to the temporal dead zone.
- **Function declarations** are hoisted along with their implementation, allowing them to be called before they appear in the code.
- **Function expressions** (like assigning a function to a variable) are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations and 
    behave similarly to variable declarations.
