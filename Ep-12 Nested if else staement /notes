In JavaScript, a **nested `if-else`** statement refers to placing an `if-else` statement inside another `if-else` block. 
 This is useful when you want to check multiple conditions and create more complex decision-making structures.

Here's the basic syntax for a nested `if-else` statement:

```javascript
if (condition1) {
    // Code block executed if condition1 is true
    if (condition2) {
        // Code block executed if condition2 is true
    } else {
        // Code block executed if condition2 is false
    }
} else {
    // Code block executed if condition1 is false
    if (condition3) {
        // Code block executed if condition3 is true
    } else {
        // Code block executed if condition3 is false
    }
}
```

### Example:

Let's say you're checking if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and citizenship:

```javascript
let age = 25;
let isCitizen = true;

if (age >= 18) {
    if (isCitizen) {
        console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
    } else {
        console.log("You are not a citizen, so you cannot vote.");
    }
} else {
    console.log("You are not old enough to vote.");
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The first `if` checks if the person is 18 or older.
2. Inside that block, another `if` checks if they are a citizen.
3. If both conditions are met, they are eligible to vote. Otherwise, the appropriate message is shown based on the inner condition.

If the age is less than 18, the outer `else` will handle that case and tell the person they can't vote.
