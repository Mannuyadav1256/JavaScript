The ternary operator in JavaScript provides a concise way to perform conditional operations. It works as a shortcut for the `if-else` statement,
allowing you to make a decision in a single line of code. The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
let age = 18;
let isAdult = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(isAdult); // Output: Yes
```

In this example, the condition `age >= 18` is evaluated. If it's true, `isAdult` is set to "Yes"; otherwise, it's set to "No". 
It's a handy way to streamline your code when you have straightforward conditional logic.
