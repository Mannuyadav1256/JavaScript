Q.1 What does it mean to 'debug' a JavaScript program?

 "Debugging" a JavaScript program means identifying, diagnosing, and fixing errors (or "bugs") in the code to ensure the program
  runs as expected. These bugs can be logical errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, or unexpected behaviors.

Here's what the debugging process generally involves:

1. **Identifying Errors**: This can be done by observing error messages in the console or noticing that the program isn't functioning
      as expected. You might also use tools like browser developer tools (Chrome DevTools) or IDEs with debugging support.

2. **Examining Code**: After detecting where the error occurs, you review the code around the error and logic flow to understand 
       what's going wrong.

3. **Using Debugging Tools**: Many modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) that allow you to:
   - Set **breakpoints** (pause execution at a specific line of code),
   - Inspect **variables** and their values,
   - View the **call stack** (the order in which functions are called),
   - Step through the code line by line to trace its execution.

4. **Fixing Errors**: Once the problem is understood, you make the necessary changes to correct it. This could involve fixing syntax
      errors, rewriting sections of logic, handling edge cases, or making performance optimizations.

5. **Testing**: After making changes, it's important to test the program again to make sure the issue is resolved and no new issues
         were introduced.

In short, debugging is about finding and fixing the problems in your code to ensure it behaves correctly.


Q.2  And why should we learn to debug our code?

Learning to debug your code is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Identifying and Fixing Issues**:  Bugs (errors) are inevitable in software development.
     Being able to debug helps you identify what's going wrong in your code and fix it efficiently,
     ensuring the program works as expected.

2. **Improved Problem-Solving Skills**: Debugging forces you to think critically about how your code works and how different
     parts of the program interact. This strengthens your logical thinking and helps you become a better problem solver.

3. **Faster Development**: If you can quickly identify and fix bugs, you'll spend less time trying to figure out why your code
      isn't working and more time building and improving your software.

4. **Understanding the Code Better**: Debugging helps you understand your code more deeply. As you inspect variables, trace execution, 
        and fix issues, you get a clearer picture of how the program is functioning, and you become more familiar with its behavior.

5. **Avoiding Future Bugs**: By learning to debug and understanding the root cause of an issue, you can learn how to avoid similar
         problems in the future. It helps you write more reliable code.

6. **Handling Complex Code**: As codebases grow, debugging becomes essential for working with complex logic, third-party libraries, 
        or when you inherit someone elseâ€™s code. Debugging tools and techniques help you untangle those complex interactions.

7. **Better Collaboration**: Debugging is a key skill when working in a team. It helps you identify issues in your code before others 
         encounter them, and it allows you to help teammates solve problems they may face in the code.

In short, debugging is a vital skill for writing clean, efficient, and reliable code. It helps you become more confident and effective
in your coding, leading to better software and faster problem resolution.
